        <h1>Self-Regulation</h1><p>Manages impulses, attention, and emotions via a cycle of self-monitoring, analysis and self-adjusting.</p>
        <h1>Sense-Making</h1><p>Converts raw data into structured schemas by integrating metacognitive signals, addressing allocentric perspectives, reconciling discrepancies across inputs, and revising preconceptions, by exploring, reframing, and testing ideas.</p>
        <h1>Critical Thinking</h1><p>Evaluates assertions by estimating the prior plausibility of the proposition, assessing source reliability, distinguishing between claim, evidence and inference as separate justificatory layers, and evaluating logical validity and evidential relevance.</p>
        <h1>Objectivity</h1><p>Mitigates motivated reasoning by identifying uneven evidentiary standards, then uniformly applying empirical criteria (measurement and replication) and rational criteria (bayes-updating) to all conclusions, through impersonal rules and self-critique.</p>
        <h1>Fairness</h1><p>Maintains impartial balance by using an objective input–outcome ratio to weigh empathy relative to intent, against accountability relative to consequence.</p>
        <h1>Self Reflection</h1><p>Causal attribution that involves separating personal choices from external circumstances, identifying recurring patterns and controllable levers of influence, and converting insights into action.</p>
        <h1>Self Efficacy</h1><p>Grounds self-belief in past achievements, frames setbacks as temporary skill gaps rather than personal flaws, and periodically reassesses skills to pit subjective belief against objective competence.</p>
        <h1>Self-Discipline</h1><p>The establishment of priorities and the persistent implementation of goals, achieved by voluntarily inhibiting "wants" to pursue "shoulds" amid internal conflict, thus aligning behavior to long-term objectives.</p>
        <h1>Temperance</h1><p>Allocates effort according to strategic importance rather than sunk costs, minimizes unnecessary decision load or temptation exposure, and selects regulation strategies that preserve resources for highest priorities.</p>
        <h1>Perseverance</h1><p>Goal-directed persistence of action, through the overriding of avoidance urges, committing to valued outcomes, and utilizing gradual exposure and skill-development to reduce fear-driven withdrawal.</p>
